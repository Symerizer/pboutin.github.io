Some missions are like "Go hack those 6-7 indicated portals and we will give you a medal", buy some can be much, much harder.

What does those "???" means ? It means that you will have to figure out which portals you will have to visit based on a clue. Some are obvious, some are not. 

Before we get started, let's be clear about actions that will habe to be done :

So here's the complete walkthrough :

*Note that for a "Capture portal" action, a simple resonator install/upgrade will be enough, you don't have to JARVIS an ally portal to complete this.*  

1 - Stade Telus - Capture portal  

2 - Jardin Pédagogique U. Laval - Hack portal

3 - Sculpture Hema Quebec - Create control field  

4 - Fontaine Caseault - Capture portal  

5 - Foresterie U. Laval - Capture portal  

6 - Cadran Solaire - Create control field  

7 - Pavillon Agathe Lacerte - Mod portal  

8 - Statue qui est ben tanné de l'hiver - Capture portal  

9 - Pavillon de la médecine dentaire - Hack portal

Here you go, enjoy your new medal !
